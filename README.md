# LotteryApp

LotteryApp is a Python application designed to fetch, analyze, and display Powerball lottery data. It uses Selenium for web scraping, SQLite for local data storage, and PyQt6 for a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Features
- **Fetch Lottery Data**: Retrieve Powerball numbers from the Kentucky Lottery website.
- **Analyze Numbers**: Identify the most and least frequent numbers in the database.
- **Filter Results**: Filter lottery draws by a specific date range.
- **Pick Winners**: Generate "most likely," "least likely," or random lottery numbers.
- **Clear Output**: Reset the interface to a clean state.

## Requirements
To run this application, ensure the following are installed:
- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- **Required Python Libraries**:
  - `PyQt6`
  - `selenium`
  - `sqlite3` (built into Python)
- **Microsoft Edge WebDriver** (for Selenium)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/LotteryApp.git
cd LotteryApp
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install PyQt6 selenium
3. Download and Configure Edge WebDriver
Download the Microsoft Edge WebDriver that matches your Edge browser version.
Place the WebDriver executable in a folder on your system (e.g., C:\WebDrivers).
Update the path in the LotteryApp.py file:
python
Copy code
service = Service(r"C:\WebDrivers\msedgedriver.exe")
4. Run the Application
Start the application with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python LotteryApp.py
5. Ignore the Database File (Optional)
If you're using Git, add the database file (lottery_data.db) to a .gitignore file to prevent it from being tracked:

Create a .gitignore file in the root of the project folder.
Add the following lines to the .gitignore file:
plaintext
Copy code
lottery_data.db
__pycache__/
*.pyc
Run the following commands to remove the database from tracking:
bash
Copy code
git rm --cached lottery_data.db
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Added .gitignore and removed lottery_data.db from tracking"
git push origin main
How to Use the Application
Fetch Data:

Click the "Fetch Lottery Data" button to retrieve Powerball numbers.
Use the "Fetch All Historical Data" checkbox to fetch all available draws.
Filter Results:

Select a start and end date to filter the lottery draws within a specific date range.
Click "Filter Results" to display the filtered data.
Analyze Numbers:

Click "Analyze Numbers" to find the most and least frequent white balls and Powerball numbers.
Pick Winners:

Click "Pick Winners" to generate random numbers or predict the most likely/least likely numbers.
Clear Output:

Use the "Clear Output" button to reset the display area.
Notes
The database file (lottery_data.db) is created automatically on the first run and updated whenever new data is fetched.
Ensure you have an active internet connection when fetching data.

Notes
The application automatically creates a database file named lottery_data.db on the first run. This file stores all fetched lottery data locally.
Ensure you have an active internet connection when fetching data.
Troubleshooting
WebDriver Errors:
If the application fails to fetch data, ensure the Microsoft Edge WebDriver version matches your browser version.
Check that the WebDriver path in the code is correct.
Dependencies:
